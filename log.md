What if I got a PhD in an area that made an impact? I could set an example for the kids
who missed the traditional path. The kids that strayed in their twenties. Hit the booze, 
prioritized the wrong things, and now find themselves lost. I could show them that it's possible
to be your fittest and most productive well past your thirties. Selfishly, I love the intelluctual
endeavour. I want to prove to myself that I can do this. I want to meet great people and learn from them.

cool... so max diameter of n-nary trees is a fun one. where would someone apply such a thing in real life?
surely, there's a fun practical application. chatgpt is saying the diameter of a network of computers is a good example.
how is that important? well, actually as I look ahead at gpt's suggestions it aids estimating how long a message
will take to get from one computer to another. thanks, boris. i prefer to call these gpt's boris... its more personable.
