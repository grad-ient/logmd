Ok... fun times. This week's focus is on building out a few candidate models for the TB project.
It's basically a property recsys - it's a ton of fun getting back into tangible machine learning
over API gymnastics with foundational models. I'll sprinkle in some competitive programming and math
academy to keep the brain sharp.

Annually I ponder what it would be like to go into research. Get a PhD. I think about how my journey
is in reverse.I want to prove to myself that I can do it. I want to meet great people and learn from them.

Cool... so max diameter of n-nary trees is a fun one. where would someone apply such a thing in real life?
Surely, there's a fun practical application. ChatGPT is saying the diameter of a network of computers is a good example.
How is that important? well, actually as I look ahead at gpt's suggestions it aids estimating how long a message
will take to get from one computer to another.
